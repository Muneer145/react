stuff ive learnt about react.

# 1 United Team search 
a simple react app that shows Manchester United players and their positions with a search bar that filters the players

- first we use create react app
  - create react app already has all the configurations needed, instead of having to set babel and webpack so older browsers can read it

  - we run it using npx create-react-app  app-name
  
  - The source folder is were our application lives.All the react code we are going to write goes to the src folder
  - the public folder is where all files that our olders browser can read goes to 

  - when we call "yarn build" (build  react script), alll the code in our source folder gets added to our publi folder in a format that older browsers can understand 

  - "yarn test" runs the test code we are going to write
  
  - "yarn eject" takes out all the configurations files thats hidden from us for babel and webpack
